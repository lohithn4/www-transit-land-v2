title: Query schedules using the Datastore API

The Transitland Datastore schedule API collapses the many elements of a schedule into an entity. Transitland models each trip between two stops as an edge, called a `ScheduleStopPair` (SSP). Each SSP contains an origin stop, a destination stop, a route, an operator, and arrival and departure times. Each edge also includes a service calendar, describing which days a trip is possible. Accessibility information for wheelchair and bicycle riders is included, if available.

Some of this data is normally split across multiple GTFS tables, but is here denormalized for simpler access: each edge contains enough information to get from one stop to another, to another, and finally to your destination.

## Data types

Times can be specified with more than 24 hours, as indicated by GTFS. For example, 25:10 is 1:10am the day after the trip begins.

### Timepoint source

 * `gtfs_exact`: An exact timepoint in the GTFS
 * `gtfs_interpolated`: An interpolated timepoint in the GTFS
 * `transitland_interpolated_linear`: Interpolated based on linear stop sequence
 * `transitland_interpolated_geometric`: Interpolated based on straight-line distance
 * `transitland_interpolated_shape`: Interpolated based on `shape_dist_traveled`

### Pickup (origin) and drop-off (destination)

 * `null`: Regularly scheduled pickup and drop-off
 * `unavailable`: Pickup or drop-off not available
 * `ask_driver`: Ask the driver for pickup or drop-off
 * `ask_agency`: Phone the agency to schedule in advance

### Frequency-based schedules

A frequency-based schedule runs at an interval, instead of at specific departure and arrival times. When `frequency_type` is present, the trip is repeated every `frequency_headway_seconds` beginning at `frequency_start_time` and ending at `frequency_end_time`. See the [GTFS documentation for frequencies.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/frequencies-file) for more information.

The values for `frequency_type` are:

 * `exact`: service is exactly scheduled.
 * `not_exact`: service repeats, but timepoints are not exact

## Query parameters

The main ScheduleStopPair API endpoint is [/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs). It accepts the following query parameters, which may be freely combined.

| Query parameter        | Type | Description | Example |
|------------------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `origin_onestop_id`        | Onestop ID | Origin Stop. Accepts multiple separated by commas. | [from Embarcadero BART](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?origin_onestop_id=s-9q8znb12j1-embarcadero) |
| `destination_onestop_id`   | Onestop ID | Destination Stop. Accepts multiple separated by commas. | [to Montgomery St. BART](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?destination_onestop_id=s-9q8yyxq427-montgomeryst)
| `route_onestop_id`         | Onestop ID | Route. Accepts multiple separated by commas. | [on Muni N](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?route_onestop_id=r-9q8y-n) |
| `route_stop_pattern_onestop_id` | Onestop ID | Route Stop Pattern. Accepts multiple separated by commas. | [with Route Stop Pattern](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?route_stop_pattern_onestop_id=r-9q8y-n-21866a-06d86d) |
| `operator_onestop_id`      | Onestop ID | Operator. Accepts multiple separated by commas. | [on BART](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?operator_onestop_id=o-9q9-bart) |
| `date`             | Date | Service operates on a date | [valid on 2015-10-26](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?date=2015-10-26) |
| `service_from_date`        | Date | Service operates on a date, or in the future | [valid on and after 2015-10-26](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?service_from_date=2015-10-26) |
| `service_before_date`      | Date | Service operates up to and including date | [valid on and before 2015-11-30](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?service_before_date=2015-11-30) |
| `origin_departure_between` | Time,Time | Origin departure time between two times | [departing between 07:00 - 09:00](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?origin_departure_between=07:00:00,09:00:00) |
| `trip`                     | String | Trip identifier | [on trip '03SFO11SUN'](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?trip=03SFO11SUN) |
| `bbox`                     | Lon1,Lat1,Lon2,Lat2 | Origin Stop within bounding box | [in the Bay Area](http://transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs?bbox=-123.057,36.701,-121.044,38.138)

The `date` and `origin_departure_between` query parameters accept special values.

 * `date=today`: Use the current local date.
 * `time=now`: Use the current time. You can also specify `now+<seconds>` or `now-<seconds>`. Example: `time=now-600,now+600`.

 For both of these options, a local timezone must be specified by providing one of the following parameters: `origin_onestop_id`, `destination_onestop_id`, or `operator_onestop_id`.

Note: When you query `schedule_stop_pair`, the origin and destination must be directly connected without any stops between them. For example, you can query stops that are next to each other or are coupled as an express route. To find all the trips that travel between certain stops, use the [Mapzen Turn-by-Turn API](https://mapzen.com/documentation/turn-by-turn/api-reference/) with multimodal costing, which can extract the intermediate stops and do route planning.
