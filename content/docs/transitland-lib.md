`transitland-lib` is a library and command-line tool for reading, writing, and processing transit data in [GTFS](http://gtfs.org) and related formats. The library is structured as a set of data sources, filters, and transformations that can be mixed together in a variety of ways to create processing pipelines. The library supports the [DMFR](https://github.com/transitland/distributed-mobility-feed-registry) format to describe feed resources.
