title: Get started with contributing to the Feed Registry
---

Transitland's directory of transit operators and feeds, known as the [Feed Registry](/feed-registry/), has been expanding rapidly. Just two weeks ago, we launched the ability for you to [submit feeds](/news/2016/02/08/help-us-catalog-the-transit-feeds-of-the-world.html) to the Feed Registry. Since then, almost 50 feeds have been added, representing many agencies and several countries.

Transit enthusiasts like you made this possible. Thanks to those who have already submitted feeds, and please continue your contributions!

If you want to add a feed but need some guidance to get started, have a look at [this video](https://vimeo.com/155911567) that walks you through the feed submission process. To suggest a feed, you only need to know the link to it; any additional information you can include is helpful, but optional.
