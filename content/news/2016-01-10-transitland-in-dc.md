Each January brings thousands of "transpo" professionals and enthusiasts to Washington, D.C. to discuss train schedules, road pavement, bridge engineering, and the many other intricacies of transportation. [Transportation Camp](http://transportationcamp.org/events/dc-2016/) is an unconference that welcomes enthusiasts of all stripes, while the [Transportation Research Board's annual meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) is a more staid if also more massive meeting of professionals.

Mapzen will be at the TRB meeting to discuss the [Transitland open transit data service](https://transit.land) and the [Mapzen Turn-by-Turn routing engine](https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla). We'll be presenting at a TRB workshop called ***[Transformative Trends in Transit Data: General Transit Feed Specifications Bonanza](https://annualmeeting.mytrb.org/Workshop/Details/2446)*** on Sunday, January 10. Bring a laptop and learn how to create transit data from our colleagues at [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport), [Trillium Solutions](http://trilliumtransit.com/), [SUNY Albany](http://www.albany.edu/avail/), [MIT](http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/), and [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/). (TRB registration is required to attend.)

And for a second year in a row, Mapzen is joining up with our colleagues at [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com/) and [TransitScreen](http://transitscreen.com/) to host a happy hour for mapping and "transpo" types of all sorts. All are welcome on the evening of Tuesday, January 12&mdash;TRB registration is not required to attend&mdash;but ***[please RSVP if you'll be joining us at the happy hour](https://trbparty.splashthat.com/)***.

Can't make it to D.C. next week? Transportation Camp is popping up in at least [four more cities around the U.S. later in 2016](http://transportationcamp.org/). And in the meantime, you're invited to try out [Transitland](https://transit.land) and [Mapzen Turn-by-Turn](https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla) here on the Internet.
